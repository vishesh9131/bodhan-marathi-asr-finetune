"""Long-form transcription for bodhan-ai/indic-transcribe-core.

The wrapper decodes whole files and refuses audio past ~45 s. The checkpoint trains at
max_duration 30; past roughly that length one decoding pass collapses into repetition
(on a 154 s file, WER 88% -> 249% as the token budget rises), and the decoder's fixed
1024-position table caps any single pass. So we cut at natural pauses into <=30 s
pieces and decode each one.

Settings are measured, not tuned by eye. On a 42,764-clip benchmark the cost of cutting
falls with chunk length: cap 10 s +1.89 OIWER, 15 s +0.85, 20 s +0.29, 25 s +0.09,
30 s +0.00. DO NOT LOWER the 30 s cap; raising it past 30 s breaks the model.

Only needs what the model already needs: torch, torchaudio, soundfile.
