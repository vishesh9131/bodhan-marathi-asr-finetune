"""Language identification with the IndicCanary checkpoint.

docs/asr/caveats.md says the model "is language-conditioned; there is no LID" —
true of the *transcription* path, but the checkpoint can identify the language
itself, and the legacy NeMo pipeline used it to do exactly that.

The trick: the frozen canary2 prompt is

    [<|startofcontext|>, <|startoftranscript|>, <|emo:undefined|>, <|LANG|>, <|LANG|>, ...]
     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ids [7, 4, 18] ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   position 3

so feeding only the first **three** tokens and reading the distribution at the next
position asks the model which language token belongs in the ``source_lang`` slot. It is
one decoder step, not autoregressive generation: cost is dominated by the encoder pass.

Verified against the NeMo implementation on 64 real podcast chunks that carry a NeMo LID
label: **62/64 (96.9%) top-1 agreement** -- that is agreement with NeMo, NOT accuracy;
the two implementations agree closely *and are wrong together* on the confusable pairs
(see the measured accuracy under "How good is it, really" below); prob median 0.9998 (NeMo) vs 0.9990 (here);
mean |Δprob| 0.0305 on agreeing rows. Both disagreements were ``hi``/``ur`` at low
confidence (0.68, and one exact 0.4993 tie) — the pair the model genuinely cannot
separate (a wrong label yields confidently wrong *script*), so callers should resolve
hi/ur from metadata rather than from this score.

How good is it, really
----------------------
Measured on the two labelled benchmarks with the corpus scorer in the serving engine
(337k clips, zero failures; full score vectors under ``amk/lid_phase2``):

===================================  =========  ========
policy                                 lattice       VOI
===================================  =========  ========
no restriction (189 vocab languages)    0.8640    0.7791
``TRAINED_LANGS`` (27)                  0.8640    0.7791
``RECOMMENDED_LANGS`` (27 - bgc,bhb)    0.8643    0.7927
===================================  =========  ========

Two things follow, and both are the opposite of what one would guess.

**Restricting to the trained 27 does nothing.** Not "little" -- nothing: identical
accuracy to four decimals on both corpora, and an unchanged prediction for every
single clip. The model has already learnt not to emit the ~162 language tokens it
was never trained on, so the filter never fires.

**The damage is done by trained languages acting as sinks.** ``bgc`` (Haryanvi) is
never a ground-truth label in either benchmark yet absorbs 16,429 predictions,
5,681 of them Punjabi. Dropping it lifts ``pa`` from 0.620 to 0.775 (+15.5 points)
and costs nothing measurable, which is why it is excluded by default below.
``bhb`` absorbs nothing but is excluded with it as a near-neighbour of gu/mr on
the same argument.

``hne`` is the hard case and is deliberately NOT excluded. It absorbs even more
(``bho`` -> ``hne`` 9,843; ``hi`` -> ``hne`` 8,376; ``mai`` -> ``hne`` 6,574) and
dropping it would raise the macro average from 0.829 to 0.858 -- but ``hne`` is a
real language we serve, with 10,627 clips at 0.883 accuracy of its own. Trading a
supported language away for someone else's accuracy is a product decision, not a
metric one, so it is left to the caller.

Per-language accuracy is very uneven and the average hides it. Strong: ``ml``
0.979, ``ta`` 0.979, ``kn`` 0.967, ``bn`` 0.964. Weak, because a close neighbour
eats them: ``bho`` 0.047, ``hi`` 0.258 (VOI) / 0.428 (lattice), ``mai`` 0.356,
``ur`` 0.490. **Do not use LID for hi/bho/mai/ur if you have any metadata at all.**

There is no useful default confidence threshold. Filtering by probability does
raise accuracy on what survives (0.779 -> 0.836 at p>=0.7 on VOI) but coverage
falls faster, so accuracy over the whole corpus only ever drops. A threshold pays
off solely when the caller has something to fall back to; the curve is in
``report_*.txt`` if you do.

Nothing here changes the transcription path: it is additive and read-only w.r.t. the
model.
